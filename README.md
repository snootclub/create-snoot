# Create snoot
## the snoot maintenance module

This is the module used on the [snoot.club](https://snoot.club) server for
creating and working with snoots.

It's specific to the setup of that server and would need changes in order to be
useful to anyone else, but the code is here should anyone ever want to look at
it or reuse any of the code.

It would be nice to make the non-specific parts of it work without running in
that environment, so one could have a local snoot setup, but

## commands

### snoot create

create a new snoot.

this starts an interactive prompt that asks you some questions.

first it will celebrate that there is a new snoot:

```
oh, a new snoot? ðŸ’•
```

then it will ask for a `name`, and a `githubUsername`.

```
? what's their name?
? what's their github username?
```

it'll grab their authorized_keys file from
`https://github.com/${githubUsername}.keys`

then it will let you edit their authorized_keys in your `$EDITOR` so you can add
any others you've been provided.

once it's gathered all that snoot data, it will create them a unix user with
that `name`, putting them in the groups `common` and `undercommon`.

the tool will then create them a base application at
`/www/snoot.club/snoots/${name}`. at the moment this base application is defined
in the
[skeletons](https://github.com/snootclub/create-snoot/blob/40d842fa2d9c957014d85f815a3e8e601a6cd903/library/skeletons.js)
file. in brief, it has:

* `snoot.json` â€” some meta data about a snoot
* `nginx.conf` â€” an nginx configuration that defers mostly to blocks defined at
  [snootclub/nginx.conf](https://github.com/snootclub/nginx.conf)
* `application/package.json` â€” an [npm package
  manifest](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) that uses
  [boop](https://github.com/snootclub/boop) for `build`, `watch` and `install`
  and [zeit's micro](https://github.com/zeit/micro) for `start`
* `application/index.js` â€” entry point that defers to
  [boop](https://github.com/snootclub/boop)
* `application/website/index.html` â€” a template html page that tells you how to
  access your new snoot

then it bindsðŸ‘€ the `website` directory into the snoot's sftp chroot root

and it bootsðŸ‘¢ðŸ‘¢ the snoot container

and then it restarts nginx, and updates the next snoot port file.

a few seconds later, the snoot has boot and is ready to toot

### snoot ls

list the names of all the snoot, separated by newlines.
