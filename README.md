# Create snoot - the snoot maintenance module

This is the module used on the [snoot.club](https://snoot.club) server for creating new snoots. 

It's specific to the setup of that server and would need changes in order to be useful to anyone else, but the code is here should anyone ever want to look at it or reuse any of the code.

It would be nice to make the non-specific parts of it work without running in that environment, so one could have a local snoot setup, but that's not the focus right now.
